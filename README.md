## How to set up Python

On the Jupyter Server, Python and Conda are already installed. You can install all packages you need for the lab by
running the following in your terminal:

````bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

In case you need a new package `package_name`, you can install it by running:

````bash
pip install package_name
````

A list of package can be found here: [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/).

## Working with git

Git is a Version Control System (VCS) that allows you to keep track of changes in your code. You can use it to
collaborate with others. The two main actions are updating your local repository and updating the online repository.

### Updating your local repository

To update your local repository, you need to pull the changes from the online repository. You can do this by running:

````bash
git pull
````

### Updating the online repository

To update the online repository, you need to commit your changes and push them to the online repository. You can do
this by running:

````bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
````

If your have problems, questions, or feel unsafe, please ask one of the faculty members for help.
